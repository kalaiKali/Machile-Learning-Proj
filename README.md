Predicting Crime Types Based on Historical Data: A Machine Learning Approach
Business Problem:
The dataset Crime Data from 2020 to the Present contains details regarding crimes in various cities around the City of Los Angeles between January 2020 and the present day. The dataset has attributes for the location, date, and time of the offense and the type of crime that was committed. Based on the location, victim sex, victim race, victim age, date, and time of the incident, a machine-learning model can be created using the dataset to forecast the sort of crime that will be committed.
The goal of this project is to create a machine-learning model that can identify the kind of crime being committed based on the location, the time and day it occurs, and other information. This can help law enforcement officials effectively utilize their resources and prevent crimes from happening in the future.
